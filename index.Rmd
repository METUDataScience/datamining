Welcome to Knowledge, Discovery and Mining. This lecture will be given by [Assoc.Prof.Dr.Tugba Taskaya Temizel](https://blog.metu.edu.tr/ttemizel/). The assistant who will be doing the applied portion of the course is [Mehmet Ali Akyol](https://mehmetaliakyol.com). 

This page will contain the lab codes for the class as RMarkdown documents. You can go to the [Github repository](https://github.com/METUDataScience/datamining) for the full Rmarkdown files to use in your local environment.The entirety of materials will be available through ODTUClass. This website only aims to provide a collection of rendered RMarkdown files.
